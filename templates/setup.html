				<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" style="color:#3776ab; text-decoration: none">Install Python.</a> If you're running Ubuntu (I'm not sure about other Linux distros), you will have Python built in. If you're running Windows, follow the link and install Python. You will have a choice of version that you can install (2.7 or 3.4). The differences between the two and the pros and cons of each is a whole different talk. Go with 2.7.8 for now. I'll give you a rundown on a few differences during the workshop.

				We'll have a few exercises during the workshop. Download the zip file from <a href="https://github.com/AlexMathew/csipy-exercises" style="color:#3776ab; text-decoration: none">this GitHub repository</a>. We'll be making some changes to it, so you'll have the most updated version by the morning of the workshop. Have the zip file with you during the workshop.

				You can help us in a huge way during the workshop. Try to have the Python installer and the exercises zip file with you in a pen drive, in case anyone else there needs it. Also, try to get a group together, and have a spike buster with you. There's only so many that we'll be able to organize. It'll be a huge help if you can get them too.
